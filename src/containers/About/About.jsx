  I'm a developer from ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡½ MX City. I'm all about building digital tools, multimedia art and experiences. 
  When I'm not working with the awesome product team @ SalesLoft, I'm probably making sounds with 
  synths and guitars, tinkering with some new tech (serverless recently ðŸ–¤) or cooking something from scratch.
